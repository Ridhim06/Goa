It is believed that Sumerian civilization was existed dating back 2000 BC. These people introduced their ideas of all types with the result that the ownership of the land vested in the main village diety. The co-operative farming turned into common holdership or villages who were considered to be founders of the village commune and its administration took a form of oligarchic democrocy. The Aryans of the first wave accepted this type of administration and improved upon it.

Mainly Aryans consisted of Bhojas, Chediyas, Kshatriyas and Brahmins were arrived in Goa. Bhojas ruled over Goa from aobout 4th century AD to 6th century AD. It is believed that Brahmins were migrated to Goa by Parashurama from Kasmir and the banks of the river Sarawati. Kadambas also ruled over Goa, they were originally from Karnataka.
